# The mesh table is the main table which is piped
# into the kernel table. Every mesh specific
# table exports it routes to the mesh table and import
# routes which are not in the mesh specific prefix.
# The mesh_${site} tables exchange routes with the local
# peers from here routes to local subnets are communicated 
# and routes to other communities from icvpn peers in the local
# network are exchanged. 
# 
# If this router is a icvpn peer then routes from the
# icvpn will be exchanged directly with the mesh table.
